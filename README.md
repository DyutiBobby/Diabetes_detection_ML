# Detection and Prediction of Diabetes

#In today's society, Diabetes Mellitus affects a large portion of the population. The purpose of this research is to examine a few Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to assist in prediction of Type 2 diabetes, a disorder that alters the body's blood sugar processing. For the diabetes prediction proposed, the prominent PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset was utilized. Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), XGBoost (Extreme gradient boosting), and Random Forest Regression are the techniques that were investigated. SVM yields an accuracy of 84.5%, sensitivity of 88.00% and specificity of 81.00%. KNN yields an accuracy of 80.5% sensitivity of 83.00% and specificity of 78.00%. XGBoost yields an accuracy of 83.41 %, sensitivity of 80.18% and specificity of 86.61%. Random Forest Regression yields an accuracy of 91.26%, sensitivity of 82.76% and specificity of 98.96%. Diabetes may be detected early and treated promptly, slowing the course of the disease. Using an ML model to reliably foresee Type 2 diabetes might prove beneficial. As a result, machine learning and artificial intelligence have found a home in the healthcare industry. The Random Forest method should be used for a far more accurate and specific identification, according to a comparison of the models.
